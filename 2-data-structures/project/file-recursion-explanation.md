#Problem 2 (File recursion) solution
To solve this problem, I just used simple recursion. The time complexity would be O(n), being n the total number of elements in the directory where the search will be done. This is because to find the files, each and every element has to be inspected.

The worst case for the space complexity would be O(n), being n the total elements in the directory.
