#Problem 6 (Max and Min in a Unsorted Array) solution
For this problem there was no need to sort the array. Keep the track of both max and min, while traversing the list once, was easier, less complex, and required less space and time.

The time complexity of my solution **O(n),** since the list is traversed only one time.

The space complexity is **O(1)**, since the search is done in place and the result is always in constant space.
