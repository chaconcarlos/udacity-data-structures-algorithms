#Problem 1 (Finding the Square Root of an Integer) solution
I used binary search, given that its time complexity matches the expected by the problem, and doesn't require additional space.

The time complexity of my solution **O(log(n))**, since I used binary search to reduce the search space. 

The space complexity is **O(1).**. There's no need for additional space, and the result is always the same size.
