#Problem 4 (Dutch National Flag Problem) solution
I just used the common solution for this problem as explained in Lesson 2. Using indexes to traverse the list in place and switch is more efficient than building a new list, and probably less complex.

The time complexity of my solution **O(n),** since the list is traversed only one time.

The space complexity is **O(1)**, since the sorting is done in place.
